> [Link](https://medium.com/xebia-engineering/11-reasons-why-you-are-going-to-fail-with-microservices-29b93876268b)

## TLDR:

* Consider about using microservice architectures:
  * Hard on local developments.
  * Fragment in technologies and versions.
  * Lack of visibility in architectures.
* Use tool to automation process.
* Communication between services and developers.

## **1. Complexity**

* Need a productive local environment setup.
* Need good development machine.
* Build the entire application on a new machine without much configuration.
* Should use multiple docker-compose files to spin up different services.

## **2. No update libraries and tools process**

* Become a technical debt.
* Keep dependency versions in sync for all the services.
* Create technical debt items for these upgrades in their backlog.

## **3. Use shared service**

* Example: shared database
  * Developer can wipe out data written by another.
  * Experimentation as their work can impact some other.
  * Difficult to test changes in isolation.
  * Lose the traceability of the changes.
  * Difficult to work when you are not online.

## **4. Lack of visibility in version control**

* Group Microservices in some way from the start.

## **5. No clear definition**

* Have few large services than to have too many small services.
* Break a domain into subdomains and bounded contexts.
* Should only communicate through the published contracts.

  > If two pieces of information are dependent on each other, they should belong to a single server. In other words, the natural boundaries for a service should be the natural boundaries of its data.

## **6. No clear strategy on code reuse**

* Copy and paste code -&gt; need to applied fix multiple times.
* Use an artifact manager like Bintray or Nexus and publish dependencies.
* Tooling to make it easy to upgrade Microservices so that a human does not have to do this.

## **7. Polyglot programming**

* Use multiples technologies -&gt; Hard to maintain and share knowlegde.
* Need to Publishes a list of languages that teams can use.
* Think before you choose a language.

## **8. People dependency**

* teams donâ€™t understand the complete ecosystem.
* Create overall architecture team roadmap and goals.

## **9. Lack of documentation**

* Minimum:
  * Design documents.
  * Context and container diagrams.
  * Keeping track of key architecture decisions.
  * Developer onboarding guide.

## **10. Feature over platform maturity**

* Features built on a weak platform fail to deliver value.
* Need to get into the platform mentality.

## **11. Lack of automated testing**

* Automation testing is in the overall quality of the product
